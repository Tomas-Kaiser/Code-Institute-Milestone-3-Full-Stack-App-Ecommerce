# Testing 
A thorough mix of automated and manual testing have gone into building the project. In addition to tests, I have validated all files against online validation sites, and checked compatibilities across various modern browsers and devices.

## HTML
* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
   * All 25 .html files have been checked
   * Other validation issues are related to Django Templating not being recognized by W3C:
      * **Warning:** Consider adding a `lang` attribute to the `html` start tag to declare the language of this document
      * **Error:** bad value `{% foo %}`
      * **Error:** Non-space characters found without seeing a doctype first. Expected `<!DOCTYPE html>`
      * **Error:** Element `head` is missing a required instance of child element `title`

## CSS
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
   * The W3C Jugsaw validator did not found any errors. Only 3 **warnings**
      * `-webkit-background-size` is an unknown vendor extension
      * `-moz-background-size` is an unknown vendor extension
      * `-o-background-size` is an unknown vendor extension
